They improved agent F1 response quality to 98% and reduced the need for engineering intervention by 90%.\\n\\n5 min read\\nAug 15, 2024\\nAbout Podium\\nPodium is a communication platform that helps small businesses connect quickly with customers via phone, text, email, and social media. Small businesses often have high-touch interactions with customers — think automotive dealers, jewelers, bike shops — yet are understaffed. Podium's mission is to help these businesses respond to customer inquiries promptly so that they can convert leads into sales.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './data//whats_next_for_podium.txt'}, page_content='Podium data shows that responding to customer inquiries within 5 minutes results in a 46% higher lead conversion rate than responding in an hour. To improve lead capture, Podium launched AI Employee, their agentic application (and flagship product) to engage local business customers, schedule appointments, and close sales. \\n\\nInitially, Podium used the LangChain framework for single-turn interactions. As their agentic use cases grew more complex for a wide-ranging set of customers and domains, Podium needed better visibility into their LLM calls and interactions — and turned to LangSmith for LLM testing and observability.\\n\\nTesting across the agentic development lifecycle\\nEstablishing feedback loops was especially important to the agentic development lifecycle for Podium. LangSmith allowed the Podium engineers to test and continuously monitor their AI employee’s performance, adding new edge cases to their dataset to refine and test the model over time.'),\n",

With LangSmith, they quickly got set up and logged and viewed traces to aggregate insights.\\n\\nOne specific challenge Podium ran into with their AI Employee was that the agent struggled to recognize when a conversation had naturally ended, resulting in awkward repeated goodbyes. To address this, Podium began by creating a dataset in LangSmith with various conversation scenarios, including ways different conversations might conclude.'),\n",

Upgrading their model went smoothly since model inputs and outputs were automatically captured in LangSmith’s traces, allowing the team to easily curate datasets.\\n\\nPodium engineers also enriched LangSmith traces with metadata on customer profiles, business types, and other parameters important to their business. They grouped traces using specific identifiers in LangSmith, making it easy to aggregate related traces during data curation. This enriched data enabled Podium to create a higher-quality and balanced dataset, which improved model fine-tuning and helped them avoid overfitting).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './data//whats_next_for_podium.txt'}, page_content='With this balanced dataset, the Podium team then compared the results from their fine-tuned model against results from their original, larger model using pairwise evaluations. This comparison allowed them to assess how well the upgraded model could improve the agent’s ability to know when to conclude a conversation.\\n\\nAfter fine-tuning, Podium’s new model showed significant improvement in detecting where natural conversation should end for its agent. Podium’s F1 scores with the fine-tune model experienced a 7.5% improvement, going from 91.7% to 98.6% to exceed their quality threshold of 98%.\\n\\nHigh-quality customer support for AI platform without engineering intervention\\nAt Podium, engineers must understand when communications with customers go awry, so that they can keep shipping reliable and high-quality products.'),\n",

At Podium, the TPS team typically provides customer support for their small business customers. However, pinpointing the source of issues (and how to take action on them) was challenging. \\n\\nGiving the TPS team access to LangSmith provided clarity, allowing the team to quickly identify customer-reported issues and determine: “Is this issue caused by a bug in the application, incomplete context, misaligned instructions, or an issue with the LLM?” \\n\\nFor Podium, identifying the type of customer issue guided them to the appropriate interventions:'),\n",

These can be remediated by the TPS team making changes in the content authoring system to better suit business requirements.\\nFor an LLM issue: Even with necessary context, an LLM may produce unexpected or incorrect information. These require engineering intervention.\\nFor example, many car dealerships use Podium’s AI Employee to respond to customer inquiries. If the AI Employee mistakenly responds that a car dealership does not offer oil changes, the TPS team can use LangSmith’s playground feature to edit the system output and determine if a simple setting change in the Admin interface can resolve the issue.'),\n",
